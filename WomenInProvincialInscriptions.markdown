title: Women in Roman Provincial Inscriptions
permalink: /WomenInRomanPI/
---

A project with the ultimate goal of digitizing the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL) volumes II and III so that they can be filtered for the study of women living in the provinces of ancient Rome. All volumes of the CIL digitized here are out of copyright, and have become outdated with new additions to the CIL corpus.

The Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum is a vast collection of inscriptions collected from across the Roman world in a variety of ancient languages. The inscriptions are recorded as they are preserved, with some restoration by modern epigraphists. The text of the CIL is fully in Latin, with no translations of the inscriptions available in the printed additions.

Digitizing CIL corpus of Latin Inscriptions from the provinces of Spain, Egypt, and Asia in the hopes of creating a database for women in the Roman Mediterranean world.

Final corpus digitized using Google OCR.
