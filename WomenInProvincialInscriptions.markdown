## The Project and the Goal

A project with the ultimate goal of digitizing the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL) volumes II and III so that they can be filtered for the study of women living in the provinces of ancient Rome. All volumes of the CIL digitized here are out of copyright, and have become outdated with new additions to the CIL corpus.

The Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum is a vast collection of inscriptions collected from across the Roman world in a variety of ancient languages. The inscriptions are recorded as they are preserved, with some restoration by modern epigraphists. The text of the CIL is fully in Latin, with no translations of the inscriptions available in the printed additions.

Digitizing CIL corpus of Latin Inscriptions from the provinces of Spain, Egypt, and Asia in the hopes of creating a database for women in the Roman Mediterranean world.

Final corpus digitized using Fine Reader OCR, with a smattering of Google OCR.

Volume Abbreviations | Volume Number | Locations
-------------------- | ------------- | ---------
CIL II | Volume 2 | Inscriptions from Roman Spain
CIL III | Volume 3, Part 1 | Inscriptions from Roman Egypt and Asia



*Disclaimer*: This project is being done as I dip my toes into the realm of computational methods for Humanities research. I claim neither mastery nor accuracy at this point in time, this is an artifact of the learning process. 


## The Material: Considerations and Issues

Epigraphy and inscriptions are unlike literary sources, in that they were written (or rather, paid for) by individuals whose voices may not survive in any other state. At the same time, they should not be taken at face value. Inscriptions were expensive and dedicated for several reasons including:
1. Repaying a vow to the gods
2. Eulogizing a desceased loved one
3. Memorializing a great accomplishment or event, and
4. Begging aid from the gods


For these reasons, inscriptions tend to idealize the people and events for which they are dedicated and thus must be treated carefully. What these texts can reveal, however, are overarching patterns of and purposes for dedication. These patterns could be revealing when studied in conjunction with patterns of women's appearances in these inscriptions in the roles of *Dedicator* and *Dedicant*.


It should also be noted that the inscriptions collected in the CIL volumes consist of both epigraphic inscriptions (created professionally and paid for by the dedicator) and *graffito* which are inscriptions and drawing created by an average citizen that were not necessarily created for an express purpose.


## The Material: Products of Digitization

I began this project using the scanned texts of CIL II and CIL III from [HathiTrust](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100029672). These records are now obsolete as newer additions have been released, and are thus out of copy right. In terms of digitization, the corpus poses a few unique issues. 
1. The inscriptions are printed as closely as possible to their state of preservation. This means that some inscriptions are missing sections, have sections which were reconstructed by scholars, or have breaks in them which do not translate to OCR. 
2. The printed pages themselves are split into columns and sections which cause confusion for most OCR programs. I finally settled on using [ABBYY Fine Reader](https://pdf.abbyy.com/finereader-pdf/trial/) which is more adept at running OCR on tables and columns.
Below are two images of the actual printed pages of the CIL volumes. You can see why the formatting may prove difficult for text recognition softwares that read from left to right!

#### The Provinces in Question

The inscriptions from CIL II were recovered from Roman Spain-- *Hispania*-- (light blue circle). The inscriptions from CIL III were uncovered in Roman Egypt and Asia (dark green). Thus far I have only worked with the inscriptions from the African provinces captured in the region as shown on the map below.
