I'm a Roman historian predominantly interested in studying the evolving social status of women at the end of the Republic and the start of the Empire. I have a background in Creative Writing and focus my research on the way that women were talked about in Roman literature and the way that women talked about themselves in epigraphic materials.

I earned my BA from FSU with a dual major in Classical Civilizations and Creative Writing
I am currently earning my MA in Classical Civilizations at FSU
