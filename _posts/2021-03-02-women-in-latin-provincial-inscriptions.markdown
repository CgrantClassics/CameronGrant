Welcome to my current project!

## The Project
This site will be used primarily to record my progress with digitizing Volumes II and III of the CIL. 
This is a long-term project as it involves the very slow process of digitizing and cleaning messy raw data.

# The Goal
I am digitizing these Latin inscriptions with the hope to one day establish a searchable epigraphic database of women and their lives in the Roman world. Starting with inscriptions in the provinces of Egypt, Asia, and Spain allows me to work with a large corpus of material which is not focused on the city of Rome. This data can ultimately be used to uncover the lives and concerns of real women in provincial territories who may otherwise go unnoticed for all the glamour of the Eternal City.

# The Material
Epigraphy and inscriptions are unlike literary sources, in that they were written (or rather, paid for) by individuals whose voices may not survive in any other state. At the same time, they should not be taken at face value. Inscriptions were expensive and dedicated for several reasons including:
1. Repaying a vow to the gods
2. Eulogizing a desceased loved one
3. Memorializing a great accomplishment or event, and
4. Begging aid from the gods


For these reasons, inscriptions tend to idealize the people and events for which they are dedicated and thus must be treated carefully. What these texts can reveal, however, are overarching patterns of and purposes for dedication. These patterns could be revealing when studied in conjunction with patterns of women's appearances in these inscriptions in the roles of *Dedicator* and *Dedicant*.
