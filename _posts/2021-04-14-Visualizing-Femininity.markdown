This week I spent some time working on visualizing data on feminine words and feminine endings in four provinces across my corpus: Alexandria and Thebes in Egypt, and Ossonoba and Merobiga in Spain.


My main goal was to find paterns relating to feminine words and word endings across the inscriptions, as locating words with feminine endings, in this case *-ae* or *-a*, is often the best way to find names of women or words relating to womanhood, motherhood, and wifehood. It is not a fool-proof approach, but it does yield some interesting result.

Below are some visualizations from the word-tool [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/). Voyant treats the inscriptions as a "bag of words", so it's especially helpful in seraching for terms with certain endings, spellings, or meanings if you are clear about what you're hunting for in the text. I would like to note that the tool assigned the color code for these terms, not me. I'm sure that there's a joke about unconcious bias in there somewhere...


## **Alexandria: 8 inscriptions, 297 words total, an average of 42.4 words per inscription**

## **Thebes: 4 inscriptions, 84 words total, an average of 84 words per inscription**

![Thebis Inscriptions](/CameronGrant/Assets/Fem_Endings_Thebis.png)

## **Ossonoba: 12 inscriptions, 188 words total, an average of 47 words per inscription**

## **Merobriga: 10 inscriptions, 190 words total, an average of 38 words per inscription**

Each province includes an average of 8.5 inscriptions. Thebis covers the least with only 4 inscriptions, Ossonoba the most with 12. 

The pattern that begins to emerge here is a frequency of words with feminine endings. This does not guarentee the presence of women! Many masculine oriented words and names in Latin take a feminine ending depending on their grammatical use. But it is a *start*.

**Some Initial Observations**
1. Thebes, although it has the smallest number of inscriptions, has the highest concentration of feminine endings!
2. The *-ae* ending is far more common in Alexandria than the other provinces, likely because the Latin spelling of the city's name is *Alexandriae*.
3. Ossonoba has an interesting frequency dispersal that actually looks like a proper U-curve. This could indicate a more equal dispersal of feminine words as a whole.
4. Spain appears to have a higher frequency of feminine words than Egypt does, at least across these two provinces. It will be interesting to see if the pattern holds across the corpus.


## **Digging Deeper: Finding Women**

So much for words with feminine endings! As previously stated not all of the words captured in the above graphs are representitve of words with actual femininine conotations. A great number of them are, however, names! Voyant's "reader" feature actually allowed me to take a closer look at the words and phrases captured on the frequency graphs, but more on that later. For now, let's talk about "feminine phrases".


Given the small sample size used, very few solidly feminine terms appear (i.e., "mother", "wife", "daughter", "sister", etc.). They do, however, exist. In Alexandria we see one mother (indicated by the blue bar):

In Merobriga we find one daughter (indicated by the green bar):

While these graphs do not indicate a wider pattern, they do show us that in a small sample size of inscriptions, explicitly feminine terms are less common than feminine nouns. 

The daughter, Flavia Titia, appears in Inscription 23, evidently honoring some sort of victory:

> VENERI • VICTRI CI- A V G• S ACR« IN HONOREM • LV CILIAE - LEP IDINAE FLAVIA •
TITIA • FILIAE PIENTISSIMAE

The term *pientissimae* is a (fairly high frequency term){https://www.trismegistos.org/abb/abbreflist.php?combin_id=57168] in inscriptions, and is also (common in conjunction with *filiae*)[https://www.trismegistos.org/abb/abbreflist_clust.php?word_full_clust_id=44859].


###### **Women in Ossonoba Inscriptions**


![Ossonoba Inscriptions Text](/CameronGrant/Assets/Ossonoba_a.png)

Searching for words ending in the feminine marker *-a*, produced the read file above. As you can see, all words highlighted in yellow end with that marker. The colored line graph at the bottom of the image is an assessment of the entire corpus of the frequency of *-a* words.
	
* (Alexandria = Blue, Thebes = Green, Ossonoba = Pink, Merobriga = Purple)

The exciting part about this search is what it reveals... the names of approximately three women!

> Inscription 5: IVNIA AERENNIA
>
> Inscription 8: ARTVLLIA and SEVERA

Each of these phrases is the feminine form of a Roman cognomen and indicate an indinvidual woman (the nature of inscription 8 could actually be that we are seeing one woman, but I would hazard these are two individuals).

Inscription 8 is particularly interesting as it appears on a funerary epitaph for one Lucius Atillus Maximus Severianus. The names of the women *could* be dedicants, but certainly indicate female relatives, it is unclear if they are siblings, a mother, a wife, or daughters. Their relationship is clearly important enough to the deceased to be recognized on the epitaph which is already quite long and intricate (the two "diamond" symbols are actually drawings of some sort on the physical inscription).
