This week I spent some time working on visualizing data on feminine words and feminine endings in 4 provinces across my corpus: Alexandria and Thebis in Egypt, and Ossonoba and Merobiga in Spain.


My main goal was to find paterns relating to feminine words and word endings across the inscriptions, as locating words with feminine endings, in this case *-ae* or *-a*, is often the best way to find names of women or words relating to womanhood, motherhood, and wifehood. It is not a fool-proof approach, but it does yield some interesting result.

Below are some visualizations from the word-tool [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/).


## **Alexandria**

## **Merobriga**

Each province includes an average of 8 inscriptions. Thebis covers the least with only 4 inscriptions, Ossonoba the most with 12. 

The pattern that begins to emerge here is a frequency of words with feminine endings. This does not guarentee the presence of women! Many masculine oriented words and names in Latin take a feminine ending depending on their grammatical use. But it is a *start*.

**Some Initial Observations**
1. Thebis, although it has the smallest number of inscriptions, has the highest concentration of feminine endings!
2. The *-ae* ending is far more common in Alexandria than the other provinces, likely because the Latin spelling of the city's name is *Alexandriae*.
3. Ossonoba has an interesting frequency dispersal that actually looks like a proper U-curve. This could indicate a more equal dispersal of feminine words as a whole.
