Everything is quantifiable, or at least that's what Lemercier and Zalc tell us. Any data set, any corpus, can be quantified and analyzed in some way. But can you quantify text?

Sure you can! There are a great many ways one can go about it. In the case of my current project- wherein I am serching for women in inscriptions- this can be a tad unhelpful. Since my corpus is not yet at a point where I can build a data table out of my whole corpus quantification will look fairly... off topic.

In the future I could see it being very helpful! Once my corpus is clean and I can properly search through it I could build a quantifiable data set for say... every instance of the word *filiae*, or "daughter", across all Latin inscriptions from Spain, Egypt, and Asia. Gee... wouldn't that be swell? One day it will be.

But for now, I am experimenting with quantification through a program known as R-Studio in a direction that is somewhat less relevant for the purposes of actually learning how to use the tool.

**This week's quantification goal:** How do the lengths of inscriptions vary across Roman provinces in Egypt and Northern Africa?
